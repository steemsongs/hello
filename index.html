    <h1>SteemSongs (2017–2020)</h1>
    <p>SteemSongs launched its private beta at the start of 2017. 180 people had access to v1 of the site, and we licensed 47 tracks, including the #1 album from virtuoso cellist Peter Gregson.</p>
    <p class="smaller-text">
        While we made significant progress as one of the first blockchain-based music stores, the project ultimately faced challenges in securing the right technical support and funding. Despite our best efforts, including a search for developers with expertise in the Steem blockchain and APIs, as well as a growth proposal to Steemit Inc., the project remained a solo endeavour. We’re proud of what we achieved and grateful to everyone who supported SteemSongs by purchasing music.
